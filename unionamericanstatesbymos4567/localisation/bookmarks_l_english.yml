The feeling these days in the South is, what has been done is done, but if we had known what would happen in the West ... we probably would not have done it. Because now Russia has half of the country under indirect control and wants to take over the rest. The peace will fall. We have to be prepared for the war, as the war will come for sure. We will have to fight. The US will protect Michigan from Russia, but Texas is vulnerable to attacks by these dam communist fighters. Should Texas fall, we would be next. We have to help Texas. The Texas Federation can not fall. Not yet. We also need to reassure the US, or we will have more problems."
